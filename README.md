# The DATA SCIENCE, Achitecture, AI AND ML Series

## The DATA SCIENCE, Achitecture, AI AND ML Series is usefull for exploration, research, code search, & for those trying to get some extra learning on thier own. Available in HTML OR R markdown documents, which is  a simple and easy to use plain text language doc that combines code, data, results from data operations (including plots and tables, pipelines, SP’s, inputs & outputs) with commentary all combined into a single nicely formatted and reproducible document. The series will be self contained in an RENV environment with Well Known & FAIR data sets, & citation can be sourced via hyperlinks. There are 3 angles of perspectives moving from the micro to macro, here is a quick summary.

I. Operations\Methods         II. Impact to Roles\Operating Environment         III. Movements/Trajectories 

## I. An Overview on Data Science, AI, & ML Methods
This is an overview on aspects Data Science, AI, & ML presented in HTML format with code embedded within. Any audience could grasp understanding from this presentation, and is intended to be helpfull for a variety of different purposes. Having said the above please note this implemention features a modern multi-lingual approach using R Python, Julia, Rust, Java, Scala & SQL. In addition CPU, and parallel (CPU, GPU, & Quantum) computational architectures are implemented through wrappers to C, C++, & Cuda code. Their is a focus on open source technologies, using Onyx, h2o_ai, & Spark for example, but also aspects of dealing with cloud computing (Azure, Amazon, Google). To understand the ins and outs of coding particulars inherently requires expertise in that particular domain.

## II. The series will incorporate relevent or news Worthy articles, along with Well Known Data Sets, as they pertain to various roles, for example.

-- A Data Scientist is a professional who creates programming code, applications, or platforms through implementing AI/ML/Modeling or Statistical knowledge to identify & deliver insights from data, or to ascertain capabilities which provide a competitive edge, improve profitability/efficiency, or to deliver on a product, project, program, or service quality or experience objectives. 

-- A Data Architect is a practitioner of data architecture, a data management discipline concerned with designing, creating, deploying and managing an organization’s data architecture. Data architects define how the data will be acquired, transported, stored, consumed, integrated and managed by different data consuming entities and IT systems (The Customer), as well as any applications systems interacting with said data in some way. It is closely allied with business architecture and is considered to be one of the four domains of enterprise architecture.

-- A CTO, CIO, CAO, CDO, CDsO, VP or Director of Analytics / Decision Support is a senior leader who oversees the comprehensive data/technology strategy and associated operations of an organization. Responsibilities include setting the vision, goals, and standards for data acquisition/management plan , as well as leading & managing teams of analysts, data scientists, architects and engineers. Organizations compile, acquire , research and use data to solve problems, optimize profit/efficiency, to minimize turnover/churn, or to streamline logistics, for the purpose of making better business decisions. They also assess the complex information operating environment including a host of forecasts, financials, market/product research, organizational & external human interactivity , with the goal of reaching simpler, faster, better, smarter decision data sets to improve performance or to develop new capabilities to attain or maintain a competitive advantage. Their technical expertise is paramount to stress test, the technological data processes for quality, punctuality, accuracy, reliability, & security, while exploiting & exploring in parallel.

## III.  AI / ML - How did we get here?
The theoretical base for contemporary neural networks was independently proposed by Alexander Bain in 1873 and William James in 1890. Both posited that human thought emerged from interactions among large numbers of neurons inside the brain. In 1949, Donald Hebb described Hebbian learning, the idea that neural networks can change and learn over time by strengthening a synapse every time a signal travels along it.

Artificial neural networks were originally used to model biological neural networks starting in the 1930s under the approach of connectionism. However, starting with the invention of the perceptron, a simple artificial neural network, by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1943, followed by the implementation of one in hardware by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957, artificial neural networks became increasingly used for machine learning applications instead, and increasingly different from their biological counterparts.

Modern Approaches

In 2012, technologists Thomas H. Davenport and DJ Patil declared “Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century”, a catchphrase that was picked up even by major-city newspapers like the New York Times and the Boston Globe. A decade later, they reaffirmed it, stating that “the job is more in demand than ever with employers”.
